# Sysprep Modules
Sysprep modules are used to dynamically update sysprep answer files during imaging.  Unlike other modules, these modules are only assigned to image profiles, not policies.

## Search
The search page allows you to view, delete, and archive existing modules. When a module is no longer needed, best practice is to archive the module. 
Archiving a module keeps all historical data about the module and if the module is needed again at a later date, it can easily be restored.
<br />
Sysprep modules can be filtered by the module name and category
