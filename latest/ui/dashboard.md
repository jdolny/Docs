## Dashboard

The dashboard is the initial view after logging in.  It displays some basic info such as:
* Computer checkins per hour
* Storage capacity for each com server and smb share
* Pinned policies and groups

> [!TIP]
> Pinned policies and groups will only be available to the user that pinned them.

The default page you see after login may be modified for each user from the **Users** navigation menu option.
