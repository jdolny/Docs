<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>

## 9.  Update Toems-UI Web.config
* In **Windows File Explorer**, navigate to ```C:\Program Files\Theopenem\Toems-UI```
* Right click on **Web.config**, select **Edit With Notepad++**
* Scroll to the bottom of the file to find the **<appSettings\>** section
* Change the value for **ServerName** to anything you want to identify this server.  When multiple servers are used, this is displayed in the UI to show which server you are 
connected to.
* Leave the value for **ApplicationApiUrl** alone.  This value is always relative to your Toems-UI server.  If you installed the Toems-API and Toems-UI on 
the same server the value should always be ```http://localhost:8080```.  This value tells the Toems-UI(frontend) where to find the Toems-API(backend).
* Change the value for **UploadApiUrl** to include your server's ip address or FQDN.  Replace the letters "fqdn" with the ip or the FQDN.<br/>
**Ex:** ```http://toems-01.theopenem.com:8080/``` or ```http://192.168.56.100:8080```.


> [!TIP]
> The **UploadApiUrl** value is strictly used for uploading files to Theopenem through the UI.  Typically when browsing the UI, your browser connects to the 
Toems-UI application and the Toems-UI connects to the Toems-API, with the exception of uploading files.  When uploading a file through the Toems-UI, your browser will 
connect directly to the Toems-API, skipping the Toems-UI application.  If you are having issues uploading files, it is most likely because this value is incorrect.

* Save and close the file

**A completed Toems-UI web.config file should look something like this.**

## 10.  Update Toems-API Web.config

* In **Windows File Explorer**, navigate to ```C:\Program Files\Theopenem\Toems-API```
* Right click on **Web.config**, select **Edit With Notepad++**
* Scroll to the bottom of the file to find the **<appSettings\>** section
* Change the value for **AllowCAGen** to **false**
* Change the value for **AllowProvisionKeygen** to **false**


**A completed Toems-API web.config file should look something like this.**

## 11.  Install Certificates
The certificates are used for identification, encryption, and signing with your endpoints.  The CA and intermediate need to be imported into the Windows Certificate Store
on each Theopenem server.

* Login to the Toems-UI from the server itself, do not do this remotely, these certificates are being installed on the Application Server itself, not an end user's PC.
* Select **Admin Settings** from the Navigation Menu
* Select **Certificates** from the Sub Navigation Menu
* Find the certificate with the Type **Authority** and click **Export**
* Save the File when prompted
* Locate the file that was just downloaded and **rename it** to **toems-ca**
* Find the certificate with the Type **Intermediate** and click **Export**
* Save the File when prompted
* Locate the file that was just downloaded and **rename it** to **toems-intermediate**
* You should now have the 2 certificates saved on the local server
