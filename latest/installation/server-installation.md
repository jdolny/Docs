## Server Installation (Toems)
This server installation guide will provide a complete walk through for the setup of Theopenem server (Toems) components.  These components include the **Toems-UI**, the **Toems-API**, 
the **Toec-API**, and **database**.  Video tutorials are also available [here](/video/youtube.html) if you prefer that style of instruction.
  The installation of the endpoint agent (Toec) will be covered in the [Endpoint Management section](/endpointmanagement/overview.html).  If you have not yet read the [Welcome Introduction](/), please read it before 
  continuing. 

The installation process is mostly automated with the MSI.  The entire process should take about 20 minutes for you to complete.
