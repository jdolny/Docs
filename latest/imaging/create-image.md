## Create An Image
This may sound confusing, but before you can upload an image you need to create an image.  This is just telling Theopenem information about the image you will upload in the upcoming steps.  There are 2 ways to create an image.

## Create Image From WebUI
Creating an image from the web gives you the most control over how the image is uploaded, but most people just create the image from the Image Environment.
1. Select **Images** then **New**
2. Give the image a name
3. Select the Imaging Client Environment that corresponds to the environment you will be using for the image.  linux = LIE, winpe = WIE
4. Select an Image Type
5. Select **Actions** then **Add Image**

## Create Image From Image Environment
Creating an image from the Image Environment is easier than the web but will use default values that may not be exactly what you want.
1. Boot a computer to an Imaging Environment
2. Select **Upload**
3. Select **New**
4. Give the image a name
5. The image has been created and is also now available in the WebUI
6. The upload process will start next
