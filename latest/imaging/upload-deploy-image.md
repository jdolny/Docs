## Upload Your Image
Congrats on making it this far.  It's been a long haul but the hard part is done.
<br/>
<br/>
By now you should have created your imaging environment and decided how you will boot to it.  You should also have an image prepared, shutdown, and ready to upload.  This is the easy part.
<br/>

1. Boot to your image environment
2. Login when prompted
3. It may or may not ask you to register the computer by supplying a name.  If the computer was already registered by installing Toec, it won't ask.
4. Select Upload
5. Select **New** if this is a new image.  Select **Existing** if the image already exists or you created a placeholder for it already in the Toems UI.
6. The image will begin to upload

<br/>
<br/>

You are now ready to deploy the image to other computers.
